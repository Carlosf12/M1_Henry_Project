# M1_Henry_Project: Personal Presentation Webpage

This project is a personal presentation webpage built as the first module assignment for the SoyHenry Bootcamp. It showcases my skills and journey in web development by featuring an "About Me" section, "Favorite Technologies," and an interactive "Favorite Activities" section where users can add and remove activities.

**Key Features:**

- **About Me:** A section providing a brief introduction and information about my web development journey.
- **Favorite Technologies:** A display of my preferred web development technologies with logos and names.
- **Favorite Activities:** An interactive section allowing users to:
    - View pre-generated favorite activities.
    - Add new favorite activities by providing a title, description, and image URL.
    - Delete existing favorite activities from the displayed list.
- **Responsive Layout:** The webpage is designed to adapt to different screen sizes for a better user experience.
- **Dark Mode:** A default dark theme is applied for a visually appealing aesthetic.

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML: For structuring the webpage content.
